## AWS Management Pack for Microsoft System Center
===============================================

Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a complete set of infrastructure and application services for running almost anything in the cloud---from enterprise applications and big data projects to social games and mobile apps. The AWS Management Pack for Microsoft System Center provides availability and performance monitoring capabilities for your applications running in AWS.

The AWS Management Pack allows Microsoft System Center Operations Manager to access your AWS resources (such as instances and volumes), so that it can collect performance data and monitor your AWS resources. The AWS Management Pack is an extension to System Center Operations Manager. There are two versions of the AWS Management Pack: one for System Center 2012 --- Operations Manager and another for System Center Operations Manager 2007 R2.

The AWS Management Pack uses Amazon CloudWatch metrics and alarms to monitor your AWS resources. Amazon CloudWatch metrics appear in Microsoft System Center as performance counters and Amazon CloudWatch alarms appear as alerts.
