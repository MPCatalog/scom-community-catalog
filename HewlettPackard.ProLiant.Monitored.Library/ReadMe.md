### Hewlett-Packard ProLiant Monitored Library Management Pack

Overview
HPE Management Packs for SCOM

Hewlett Packard Enterprise provides two standalone management packs for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager (SCOM). These can be used for health monitoring and alerting for HPE ProLiant servers and BladeSystem enclosures.

HPE ProLiant and BladeSystem management packs deliver the ability to quickly respond to events and alerts presented in the native SCOM format. They provide targeted integration for monitoring and root cause analysis with graphical characterization of HPE ProLiant servers, BladeSystem enclosures and subsystems from the SCOM console.

For more comprehensive HPE converged infrastructure monitoring, HPE recommends HPE OneView for Microsoft System Center.

Features and Benefits:
The HPE management packs for SCOM provide health monitoring and alerting.

HPE ProLiant Server Management Pack for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager uses SNMP or WBEM to monitor the health of HPE ProLiant servers running the Microsoft Windows Server operating system.

HPE BladeSystem Management Pack for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager monitors the health of HPE BladeSystem enclosures.
