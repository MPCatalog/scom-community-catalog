# Nutanix SCOM Management Pack
-------------------------------

The management packs collect information about software (cluster) elements through SNMP and hardware elements through ipmiutil [(Intelligent Platform Management Interface Utility)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_Platform_Management_Interface) and REST API calls and then package that information for SCOM to digest. *Note: The Hardware Elements Management Pack leverages the ipmiutil program to gather information from Nutanix block for Fans, Power Supply and Temperature.*
